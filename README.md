# BareMetalRpi

This is a simple assembly project to demonstrate how you can run bare metal programs on Raspberry Pi without needing an Operating System (OS).

The projects uses UART to send a message to a host computer (connecting using Serial cable connection) upon boot
then it reads a char (key) you pressed and outputs it to the terminal.

Hope you enjoy it.
